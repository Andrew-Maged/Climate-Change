## Introduction: <a name="Introduction"></a>
In this project, we will discuss the climate changes for African countries. Which countries climate will be better for your first vacation after the COVID-19 quarantine.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
Nowadays, we are in quarantine because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Therefore, I was curious to learn how to write my first blog when completing my Data Scientist Nanodegree program with Udacity. As an African-Egyptian, I know that Africa has a lot of beautiful places. But, the common idea is that Africa is always warm. In this blog, I will analyze climate change data and provide you with countries to visit any time of the year in moderate temperatures. If you are excited to know which country to visit in Africa after quarantine, let's continue reading!

The goal of the project is to analyze climate data provided by Kaggle that contains monthly average temperature reading for countries. Then, provide you with the countries that have moderate temperature in each month. I focused my work on trying to answer the following questions:

1. What is the average temperature for countries since 1973?
2. How does climate change over the years?
3. Which countries to visit in a specific month?
